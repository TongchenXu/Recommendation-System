This project has two parts. The first one is about getting and parsing movies and ratings data into Spark RDDs. The second is about building and using the recommender and persisting it for later use in our on-line recommender system.
## Goals
* To build an online movie recommendation system using the Collaborative Filtering algorithm from Spark MLlib.
* Build a web-application that can make movie recommendations based on user input.
* Visualize the recommended movies in a network interconnected graph.
